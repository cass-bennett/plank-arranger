# Plank Arranger
This program aims to solve the following problem:<br/>
A company buys planks of wood that come in a constant length, and cuts them
down into pieces.
If somebody at the company knows the lengths of all the pieces they'll
need, then what's the smallest number of planks they can order to make all
the pieces?
